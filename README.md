# Batch Bus Booker (B<sup>3</sup>)

For people who (try to) get the same bus at the same time and don't enjoy busywork.

### Installation instructions (Firefox)
Just [download](https://github.com/atokolyi/batch_bus_booker/releases/download/1.0.0/b3.xpi) it, should prompt for auto install, pin to toolbar to make access quicker.

### Installation instructions (Chrome)
Google wants me to pay $5 to give this option which I won't do, so if you really want to use it with Chrome you can download this repo, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode" (top right), click load unpacked (top left) and select the folder of this repo you just downloaded.

## Usage instructions
1. Install it as above.
2. Log-in to [bushub](https://wellcomegenomecampus.bushub.co.uk/) in your browser
3. Click the extension icon (bus if there or jigsaw) in the top right, right click the bus and pin it for easier access if you haven't already.
4. Click the yellow bus, enter your get on stop, get off stop, and the time that you board and get dropped off
5. Click all the dates you want to book for
6. When you next visit, all the info will be saved so you can just click the yellow bus and the day.

Enjoy!
