# Batch Bus Booker (B<sup>3</sup>)

For people who get the same bus and the same time and don't like needless forms.

### Installation instructions (Firefox)
Just [download](https://github.com/atokolyi/batch_bus_booker/releases/download/1.0.0/b3.xpi) it, should prompt for auto install, pin to toolbar to make access quicker.

### Installation instructions (Chrome)
Google wants me to pay $5 to give this option which I won't do, so if you really want to use it with Chrome you can download this repo, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode" (top right), click load unpacked (top left) and select the folder of this repo you just downloaded.

Enjoy!
